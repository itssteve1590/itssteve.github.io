    <h2>Bio</h2>
    <p class="bio">
      My name is Steven Grove, and I am currently working as a taxi driver while aspiring 
      to transition into the IT industry. I have ten years of experience in the security 
      sector, where I developed a keen eye for detail and a strong commitment to safety 
      and efficiency.
    </p><p class="bio">
      Academically, I hold GCSEs in Mathematics, Chemistry, Biology, and Physics, which have 
      given me a solid foundation in analytical and scientific thinking. While I don't have 
      specific IT skills yet, my enthusiasm for technology and problem-solving drives my 
      ambition to break into the IT field.
    </p><p class="bio">
      Outside of my professional life, I am an avid gamer who enjoys the strategic and 
      immersive aspects of the gaming world. I also practice archery, appreciating the 
      focus and precision it requires, and I love hiking, finding peace and adventure 
      in the great outdoors.
    </p><p class="bio">
      I am eager to leverage my diverse background and passion for technology to embark 
      on a new career path in IT. I aim to bring the same level of dedication and hard 
      work that has defined my professional journey thus far.
